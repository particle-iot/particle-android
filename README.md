## Open source projects

### Requirements for building

1. Get [the latest stable version of Android Studio](https://d.android.com/studio/)
2. Once you have Android Studio installed, launch it, and from the "Welcome to 
Android Studio" screen, pick "Open an existing Android Studio project".  When it prompts 
you for the project location, point it at the top-level 'build.gradle' file in the repo.
3. Once AS has finished its initial cogitating on the project, hit the "play" button on 
the toolbar to build and run the app on a device.
